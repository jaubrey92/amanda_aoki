      <p>
        Amanda Aoki is a Japanese American author who has always loved reading
        and writing about strong girls who challenge systems of power. Give her
        all the high stakes novels but a quiet, cozy life. A chronic relocator,
        she currently resides in her home city in the San Francisco Bay Area
        with her husband, daughter, and small flock of chickens. Amanda has
        degrees in Psychology, Nursing, and Human Development and, much like Mia
        Thermopolis, is a yoga doing, horse-back riding, wall climbing type of
        girl. Amanda is represented by Jenniea Carter at New Leaf Literary
        Agency
