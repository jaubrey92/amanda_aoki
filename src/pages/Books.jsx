      <h3>Silver Will Burn</h3>

      <h4>YA PARANORMAL</h4>
      <p>
        Trained from a young age on the finer points of staking and silver
        bullets, seventeen-year-old Emlyn Kaida Corgel knows that running into a
        naked guy in the woods the morning after the full moon (age appropriate
        and unreasonably attractive as he may be) is a big, bright red flag. And
        that’s before hearing about the night’s corresponding fatal “animal
        attack.” Still, she can’t take this to the Institute: the secret
        government organization that deals with all things paranormal, without
        proof. Her family has a reputation there. Well, her dad did, before he
        died. And Emlyn will, once she is able to attend their feeder college
        next year. Finding Logan, aforementioned naked guy, is not that hard in
        the age of the internet—especially not when he is a member of a rising
        local band that dances right across her sister’s For You page. But
        everything that comes after—his declaration of innocence, the Institute
        descending on their town, and the undeniable attraction between them—is.
        With help from her supernatural storm chaser of an uncle, still grieving
        mother, and budding baby witch of a younger sister, Emlyn must find the
        real killer before the Institute finds Logan. Because the longer the
        Institute is in town, the less Emlyn trusts them, and the more she is
        forced to question what kind of legacy her father left her.
